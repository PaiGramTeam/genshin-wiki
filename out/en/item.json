At last, she tore the creature's innards apart from within, breaking free.\nThis is the origin of the phrase \"Chiyo the Tiger-Bite,\" and would be changed over many years to \"Torachiyo.\"\nBut within the belly of the beast, she was stained by a deep sin and saw her comrades ripped to shreds by those blood-red teeth. Steeped in darkness as far as the eye could see, she would eventually draw her sword upon the Almighty Narukami Ogosho. Her sword-arm and one horn would be cloven, and she would flee from the city into the forest like a wounded beast. There, they say that she was taken for some unknown monster and slain by the tengu, or perhaps by the Shuumatsuban — or perhaps by a scion of the Iwakura Clan training deep in the mountains, for her features had been twisted by hatred and the agony of her wounds. Or perhaps she even met the oni-masked, sword-bearing doll near the corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her life's journey.\nFew among those who fought against the abyss in those days were spared pitch-dark dreams.

Over time, an increasing number were being damaged as a result. \nTo protect the previous two models and ensure safe cleaning, researchers utilized existent frameworks and did their best to increase the power density of core structures. In the end, they developed a third model with certain combat capabilities, which was primarily designed to drive away underwater creatures by ramming into them. The new model was rapidly manufactured on the basis of previous processes.\nHowever, the plan to further enhance \"Situation Controllers\" was suddenly terminated by the Fontaine Research Institute. After all, if these little things were capable of driving ferocious underwater creatures away, then what were all the other underwater meka for? In reality, these \"Situation Controllers\" were of no real use against the underwater creatures that actually posed a threat to the other meka, and could only deal with common fishes and damage the ecosystem.
